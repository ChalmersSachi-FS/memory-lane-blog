Redoing this assignment again
I have restarting this assignment about 3 or 4 times.

I have updated my index.html & post.html files.
I am currently updating the read me file so I know where I am in my code.

The next thing I will be working on is the CSS for the styling for my project.

I have created all folders & files, have coded all of my code into all of my files. Now I will be testing the project out.

I am currently adding images to my project & will be changing the CSS again because I do not like how my project looks.

DATE: 2/16/25 TIME: 3:49pm
Currently working on the 2.6 Exercise for this week's assignment, then I will be working on the 2.9 Assignment. Both are assignments are due on 2/17/25.
I am updating my index.html file & post.html file with a new post that I am adding.

5:17pm
I have updated my code and added a new post and picture there is an error with one of the pictures and the css between index.html & post.html is different which is getting on my nerves.
