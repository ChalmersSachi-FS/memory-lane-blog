Redoing this assignment again
I have restarting this assignment about 3 or 4 times.

I have updated my index.html & post.html files.
I am currently updating the read me file so I know where I am in my code.

The next thing I will be working on is the CSS for the styling for my project.

I have created all folders & files, have coded all of my code into all of my files. Now I will be testing the project out.

I am currently adding images to my project & will be changing the CSS again because I do not like how my project looks.
